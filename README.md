## Idea

In this project I want to build a realtime application using WebRTC. 

Some ideas and interests are:  
* Building a videochat with more than two persons.
* Building a multiplayer game in 2D graphics.
* Building a personal dashboard with RT-data like weather, traffic, appointments, geolocation/tracking of flights, ...

But I haven't decided yet..
